  extendedDescription: 'This smart home automation system connects various IoT devices to create an integrated home control platform. I developed firmware for Arduino and ESP32 microcontrollers to interface with sensors and actuators throughout the home, implemented the MQTT messaging protocol for device communication, and created a Node.js server to manage device state and user interactions. The system features voice control integration, scheduling capabilities, energy usage monitoring, and customizable automation rules. A mobile-responsive web dashboard allows users to monitor and control their home from anywhere. This project demonstrates my ability to work with embedded systems, networking protocols, and full-stack development in an IoT context.',
